From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project is the 'easy version' of the HTML/CSS Odin Project 
course in the Web Development 101 curriculum.

It demonstrates skills in developing HTML5 and CSS. It required me to research different
features of CSS and how to interact with the browser. It made me research how the
nav and footer tags work to make a top navigation bar and bottom footer. It also required
me to research how to center things on a page.
